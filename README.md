This is a simulator for command prompt/windows terminal (windows terminal recommended). 

Make sure you have Python installed.

To run, place the file in your C://Users/NAME/ folder and run "python nascar_sim.py" (or python (whatever you rename it)) and it'll run.

Put it on github so I didn't have to worry about putting a random file in discord servers.

----- THIS IS A WIP -----

Lots of features, but most notably:

Sims 36 race seasons, with support for 36 full time cars, and potential for more as seasons progress.
Features working playoffs with playoff points, round resets, eliminations, etc.
Each race displays the pole winner, stage winners (including 3rd stage for Coke 600), winner, cautions, and more
Each race has a chance of: Disqualifications, Suspensions, Silly Season announcements, Silly Season rumors, part time entries (with DNQ's if more than 40 cars), and mid season firings (halfway only for now).
There is a silly season after every season with pre loaded prospects. These prospects can also enter open cars or fill in for suspended drivers prior to their rookie season.
Independent ratings for drivers and cars for more accurate results.
Drivers age each season to determine retirements and rating changes.
If you run out of future real rookies, it will generate fake names.
Settings to determine how the season is simulated (one race at a time, quick skip to the playoffs and then one by one, or quick skip to end of season).

There is a lot more, but maybe best to experience yourself.

This is also easily modifiable so you can make any changes you would like.

Have fun!
